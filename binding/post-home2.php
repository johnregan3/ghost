							<p>Step out the front door like a ghost
	<a href="#">into the fog where</a> no one notices
	the contrast of white on white.
	And in between the moon and you
	the angels get a better view
	of the crumbling difference between wrong and right.
	I walk in the air between the rain
	through myself and back again
	Where? I don't know
	Maria says she's dying
	through the door I hear her crying
	Why? I don't know</p>

	<p>[Chorus:]
	Round here we always stand up straight
	Round here something radiates</p>

	<p>Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
	she said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
	she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
	just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
	she parks her car outside of my house
	takes her clothes off
	says she's close to understanding Jesus
	she knows she's just a little misunderstood
	she has trouble acting normal when she's nervous</p>

	<p>[Chorus:]
	Round here we're carving out our names
	Round here we all look the same
	Round here we talk just like lions
	But we sacrifice like lambs
	Round here she's slipping through my hands</p>

	<p>Sleeping children better run like the wind
	out of the lightning dream
	Mama's little baby better get herself in
	out of the lightning</p>

	<p>She says It's only in my head
	She says Shhh I know it's only in my head
	But the girl in car in the parking lot
	says "Man you should try to take a shot
	can't you see my walls are crumbling?"
	Then she looks up at the building
	and says she's thinking of jumping
	She says she's tired of life
	she must be tired of something</p>

	<p>[Chorus:]
	Round here she's always on my mind
	Round here hey man got lots of time
	Round here we're never sent to bed early
	And nobody makes us wait
	Round here we stay up very, very, very, very late</p>

	<p>I can't see nothin', nothin', round here.
	No, you catch me when I'm fallin'.
	You catch me if I'm fallin'.
	You catch me if I'm falling down on you.
	Oh man I said " I'm under the gun..."
	Round here.
	Oh man I said "I'm under the gun..."
	Round here.
	And I can't see nothin', nothin'.
	Round here.</p>
